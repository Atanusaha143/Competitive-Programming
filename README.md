There are four basic steps in solving a problem:

1. Defining the problem.
2. Generating alternatives.
3. Evaluating and selecting alternatives.
4. Implementing solutions.


If you have successfully failed the four basics then you are most welcome to use this repository.
But make sure that you understand the problem statement to compare your solutions with mine.

Happy Coading!
